# Copenhagen Hourly Bike Traffic Modeling (cph-aadbt-mini)

Reproducible pipeline for hourly bicycle ridership modeling using Copenhagen bike counter data.

## Project Goal

Build a spatial-temporal machine learning model to predict hourly bike traffic at multiple counting stations across Copenhagen. The model learns from historical hourly counts, spatial relationships between stations, and temporal patterns to estimate Average Annual Daily Bike Traffic (AADBT).
